# Digital_Music_Store

In this notebook I analyse a SQL database for a *fictional* digital music shop called Chinook, which can be compared to the iTunes Music store. Its management wants to obtain insights in its sales performance to further optimize its business strategy. The central question being asked by Chinook's management is:

**How can Chinook improve its performance and optimize its sales strategy?**

In order to answer this question, and various sub questions, this report will cover the following topics:
* Best selling product categories
* Sales performance per country
* Sales agents performance
* Customer base
* Music inventory

For this report a modified version of a SQLite database is being used from [this resource](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). The actual version used in this report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edlG-tOLPxLEWP19dBmBp_NxRmc7GAcx/view?usp=sharing). It contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables.
